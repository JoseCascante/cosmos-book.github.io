# Unsung heroes of astronomy

Our original list included 18 unsung astronomers but, unfortunately, had to be cut down to 12 in the book due to space limitations. The [website list](http://cosmos-book.github.io/unsung-heroes/) could be expanded (suggest them via Issues). Here are some possibilities:

* Hypatia of Alexandria (370 — 415): Greek mathematician and astronomer 
* Nasir al-Din al-Tusi (1201 — 1274): Persian polymath who made accurate tables of planetary movements, calculated the precession of the equinoxes, and proposed that the Milky Way was composed of a large number of individual stars.
* Alexander Friedmann (1888 — 1925): Russian physicist
* Milton L. Humason (1891 — 1972): American astronomer
* Vera Rubin (1928 —): American astronomer who found some of the first evidence for the existence of dark matter.
* Jocelyn Bell-Burnell (1943 —): Northern Irish astronomer who discovered pulsars during her PhD research at Cambridge, UK.
* Jill Tarter (1944 —): American astronomer who worked on SETI
* Claire Max (1946 —): American astronomer who helped develop the idea of laser guide stars. http://www.nature.com/news/astronomy-laser-focus-1.16741
