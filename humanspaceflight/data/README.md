# Notes

Humans who have been into space are separated into five categories:

* astronauts - USA
* cosmonauts - Soviet Union and Russia
* taikonauts - China
* international - Other countries
* tourist - Space tourists

## Country

This is either the [ISO 3166 alpha-3 country code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-3) or the [IOC country code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_IOC_country_codes) for countries that no longer exist e.g. Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia. People can have more than one country.

## Missions

The missions which have reached 100 km or higher are listed in date order with the start and end times. Some people are launched on one mission and return on another in which case they will have a blank end time on the first mission and a blank start time on the next.

## EVAs

The Extra-vehicular activites are listed with start times and durations. Durations are in the format __XXhYYm__.
