## Time in space

This field is a placeholder and may or may not exist. It comes from a NASA document and represents a minimum time the person has spent in spaceflight. The actual time may be longer - add up all their mission time and use whichever is longer.

## Missions

The missions which have reached 100 km or higher are listed in date order with the start and end times. Some people are launched on one mission and return on another in which case they will have a blank end time on the first mission and a blank start time on the next.

## EVAs

The Extra-vehicular activites are listed with start times and durations. Durations are in the format __XXhYYm__.
